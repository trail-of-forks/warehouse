<!--[[ preview('index-attestations') ]]-->

These pages document PyPI's implementation of digital attestations as 
defined in [PEP 740].

These attestations are generated by package publishers, stored and 
distributed by the Index, and used by downstream users. For brevity, we call 
them as *index attestations*.

## Quick background

*Index attestations* enable package maintainers as well as third parties (such
as the index itself, external auditors, etc.) to *cryptographically sign*
for uploaded packages.

These signatures bind each release distribution (such as an individual sdist or
wheel) to a strong cryptographic digest of its contents, allowing both PyPI
and downstream users to verify that a particular package was attested to by
a particular identity (such as a GitHub Actions workflow).

These attestations can take multiple forms, including [publish attestations]
for publicly verifiable proof that a package was published via a specific
[Trusted Publisher], or more general [SLSA Provenance] attesting to a package's
original source location.

## Supported attestations

PyPI uses the [in-toto Attestation Framework] for the attestations it accepts.

Currently, PyPI allows the following attestation predicates:

* [SLSA Provenance]
* [PyPI Publish]

## Security Model

Index attestations are only a building block in the Software Security
Ecosystem. They attest to that a software arqtifact has been built by a
specific workflow.

They prevent attacks such as :

- tampering with a software artifact after its release
- 

On the contrary, they provide no guarantee on the following :

- software quality
- maintainer compromise
