  <p>
    A Trusted Publisher for project
    <a href="{{ request.route_url('packaging.project', name=project_name, _host=domain) }}">{{ project_name }}</a>
    was used from a GitHub reusable workflow.
    The reusable workflow used was: <code>{{ job_workflow_ref }}</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Trusted Publisher was configured to allow uploads originating from that reusable workflow. PyPI currently accepts this but
    support for reusable workflows is limited due to an implementation error. In order to fix it and support all reusable workflows,
    PyPI is phasing out this way of configuring Trusted Publishers in favor of specifying the top-level (caller) workflow.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that this Trusted Publisher will stop working in the future. We recommend removing it and replacing it with one
    where the workflow filename matches the caller workflow instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically for this upload the top-level workflow used was: <code>{{ workflow_ref }}</code>.
    Therefore, the new Trusted Publisher should specify the following workflow filename: <code>{{ workflow_ref_filename }}</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can remove the old publisher and add the new one by going to the project's publishing setings, you can do this manually by going to the project's
    <a href="{{ request.route_url('manage.project.settings.publishing', project_name=project_name, _host=domain) }}">publishing settings</a>,
    deleting the existing Trusted Publisher and creating a new one with the workflow filename set to '{{ workflow_ref_filename }}'.
